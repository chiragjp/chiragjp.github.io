My long-term research goal is to address problems in human health and disease by developing computational and bioinformatics methods to efficiently reason over high-throughput data streams spanning molecules to populations. We aim to dissect inter-individual differences in human *phenomes* through strategies that integrate data sources that capture the comprehensive clinical experience, the complex phenomena of environmental exposure (e.g., high-throughput measures of the *exposome*), and inherited genomic variation. I received my PhD and MS in biomedical informatics from [Stanford University in Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html).
