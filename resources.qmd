### [Machine Learning and Biological Age](https://www.multidimensionality-of-aging.net)

Biological age is the deviation from chronological age and is hypothesized to be one causal factor for age-related disease. Biological age, however, is difficult to measure. Here, we analyzed 676,787 samples from 502,211 UK Biobank participants aged 37-82 years with deep learning artificial intelligence approaches to build a total of 331 biological age predictors on different data modalities (e.g., Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

### [The Confluence Projects](https://www.confluence-project.org)

Analytics and data resources to study the geospatial exposome in exacerbating health outcomes of the elderly population.

## Exposure-wide studies

### [Claims Analysis of Twins Correlation and Heritability](http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/catch/)

We estimate the relative contribution of genetics and shared exposome in 560 phenotypes in a large health insurance cohort analyzing data from \~60,000 twins and \~500,000 siblings.

### [Exposome Globe Browser](http://bit.ly/globebrowse)

What is the "linkage disequilibrium" of the exposome? View how biomarkers of exposures are correlated with one another and disease-related phenotypes.

### [HIV+ Exposure-wide study across Sub-Saharan Africa](https://www.chiragjpgroup.org/dhs_hiv_meta/)

Predisposition to become HIV positive (HIV + ) is influenced by a wide range of correlated economic, environmental, demographic, social, and behavioral factors. A data-driven approach to identify risk factors for HIV+ in across Sub-Saharan Africa in over 600,000 individuals.

### [Non-linear relationships between physiological indicators and all-cause mortality in the US](https://chiragjp.shinyapps.io/%20nhanes_mortality_associations/)

We document linear and non-linear relationships of 27 physiological indicators with all-cause mortality to evaluate whether the current clinical thresholds are suitable in distinguishing patients at high risk for mortality from those at low risk.

### [Data-driven characterization of exposome risk variables for type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands](https://chiragjp.shinyapps.io/t2d_relative_risk_variables/)

We query for environmental and modifiable drivers of tpe 2 diabetes risk in the Lifelines Biobank Cohort.

## Databases

### [RepoDB](http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/repoDB/)

Developing new computational approach for predicting new drug repositioning candidates? Test your predictions with our standard database for drug repositioning.

### [MeshDD](http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/MeSHDD/)

MeSHDD uses MeSH-term enrichment to discover literature-based similarities between FDA approved drugs.

## Software

### [Vibration of Effects](https://www.chiragjpgroup.org/voe/)

How do inferences change based on the parameters of statistical models? Estimate the distribution of association sizes, and p-values based on model selection, called the Vibration of Effects (VoE).
