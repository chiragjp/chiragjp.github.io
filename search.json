    "text": "Haven’t We Learned Anything About Stopping Pandemics?\nBy Eran Bendavid and Chirag J. Patel\nPublished on STAT News, 6/5/2024\nPublished in Science Advances, 6/5/2024\n\nIn the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists and public health institutions made bold claims about the effectiveness of various policy responses such as closing schools and banning public gatherings. These claims shaped government responses and had enormous effects on the lives of billions of people around the world. Does the data support those claims?\nTo answer that question, we explored whether patterns in the epidemiologic data could support claims made in the scientific literature and by public health institutions about the effectiveness of policy responses to Covid-19.\nWe were optimistic we would find some policies that were consistently helpful. We thought the data would show that early shelter-in-place containment measures in the spring of 2020 were more effective in preventing deaths than those later in the pandemic; or that case numbers would not rise after restrictions on attending schools were lifted.\nThat isn’t what we found, as we describe today in a paper published in Science Advances.\nWe studied a large number of hypotheses about Covid-19 policy impacts, without fear or favor. To do this, we used major sources of global data, including the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 Government Response Tracker and the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dashboard, on the use of any of 19 government responses in 181 countries in 2020 and 2021, and examined their relationship to four Covid-19 outcomes: cases, infections, deaths, and excess mortality. We modeled the policy effects in nearly 100,000 different ways, representing nearly 100,000 theories, each a flavor of a question about the effects of government responses to Covid-19. “Did stay-at-home policies flatten the curve?” or “Did closing schools decrease the spread of infections?” were among the hypotheses we tested. Each one of those relationships and theories are openly available. No matter how we approached these questions, the primary finding was lack of definitive patterns that could support claims about governmental policy impacts. About half the time, government policies were followed by better Covid-19 outcomes, and half of the time they were not. The findings were sometimes contradictory, with some policies appearing helpful when tested one way, and the same policy appearing harmful when tested another way. No claims about the relationship between government responses and pandemic outcomes held generally. Looking at stay-at-home policies and school closures, about half the time it looked like Covid-19 outcomes improved after their imposition, and half the time they got worse. Every policy, Covid-19 outcome, time period, and modeling approach yielded a similar level of uncertainty: about half the time it looked like things got better, and half the time like things got worse.\nWere there clearer impacts when we focused only on policies and responses that were deployed in early 2020, rather than all the way through the end of 2021? Or when looking at pandemic outcomes four weeks ahead rather that just two weeks? We examined policy effects in all these ways. No matter how we examined the data and changed the perspective on this question, the answer was uncertainty.\nYet scientists used these data to make definitive conclusions.\nClaims that government responses made Covid-19 worse are not broadly true, and the same goes for claims that government responses were useless or ineffective. Claims that government responses help reduce the burden of Covid-19 are also not true. What is true is that there is no strong evidence to support claims about the impacts of the policies, one way or the other. Our results aren’t a condemnation of government policies, but an acknowledgement of just how far the scientific data is capable of supporting these policies.\nDoes finding no consistent patterns in the relationships between government policies and outcomes mean that the same number of Americans would have died in the absence of any government responses? Absolutely not: such responses may have saved lives. But it does mean a failure to learn with any confidence what these policies have done — which is essential for trying to contain the next pandemic — and that holding strong views about policy successes or failures during the pandemic is not backed by data.\nCould more have been done to test the impact of policies and monitor their effects? Probably not, given the state of the world and the rapidity of Covid-19’s spread. But going forward, it would be helpful to learn more from this massive experience about how to inform policies with good data.\nWe propose two ways that could improve the understanding of the effect of governmental policies, which, we believe, would improve the credibility of science in the process:\nFirst, set up data collection platforms for critical health measures, nationally (or in a representative sample) and prospectively. More seminal papers about the effect of public health policies came from Israel and Qatar — two countries that collected such data — than from any other place.\nSecond, support more experimentation with public health policies. Good experiments yield credible data. Subjecting government responses to experimentation may be ethically thorny and often impractical, but subjecting millions of people to untested policies without strong scientific support for their benefits is also ethically charged. We believe that imposing policies backed by weak evidence contributed to the current state of distrust of the public health establishment.\nFor many who watched the flurry of responses by various governments generate a chaotic trajectory of seemingly at-random pandemic waves, the conclusions from our research may seem banal: of course the effects of these policies are unclear.\nFor us, however, claiming uncertainty goes against the grain of scientific norms. Nearly all scientific studies aim to strengthen support for a hypothesis. The same is true for the majority of Covid-19 policy models, with statements such as “major non-pharmaceutical interventions — and lockdowns in particular — have had a large effect on reducing transmission.” We suggest the opposite. That at least as of now, weaker or no support for claims of knowledge about the effects of governmental policies on Covid-19 better reflects a synthesis of the data on this issue.\nClaiming uncertainty goes against the grain of scientific norms, where the culture often rewards strong and striking claims. Many studies of Covid-19 policy options were unduly definitive, with statements such as “major non-pharmaceutical interventions — and lockdowns in particular — have had a large effect on reducing transmission.” In fact, the opposite is true: the data clearly indicate that the effects of these interventions aren’t known and that, at least as of now, weaker or no support for claims of knowledge about the effects of governmental policies on Covid-19 better reflects a synthesis of the data on this issue.\nImproving public health, and the public’s trust in public health science, is a long and complicated journey. But one step along that road may be for scientists to take an honest look at their own claims to knowledge about the pandemic and the efforts to contain it. We believe that having greater willingness to say “We’re not sure” will help regain trust in science. Matching the strength of claims to the strength of the evidence may increase the sense that the scientific community’s primary allegiance is to the pursuit of truth above all else.\nEran Bendavid is a professor of medicine at Stanford University.

    "text": "Data Science Approaches to Tackle the Complexity of Exposomics: Data, Use Cases, and Models\n\nIntroduction\nThe field of exposomics represents a transformative approach in understanding how environmental exposures influence human health. Traditional paradigms of environmental health, which focus on single exposure-outcome relationships, are evolving to incorporate complex, multifaceted exposures and their interactions with genetic factors. This essay explores data science methodologies and their application to exposomics, emphasizing key questions, models, and the need for comprehensive data resources.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Globe (Originally published by Chung et al, ES&T 2018)\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Health and Exposomics\nEnvironmental health has traditionally centered on identifying causality and risk associated with single exposures. However, the exposome encompasses the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, necessitating advanced approaches to understand its impact on health. The exposome includes diverse modalities such as chemicals, diet, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, all of which interact in complex ways.\n\n\nKey Questions in Exposomic Research\n\nHow much variation in disease can be attributed to environmental exposures?\nWhat specific factors of the exposome are associated with disease?\n\nThese questions drive the need for robust data science approaches to parse out the contributions of shared and non-shared environmental factors, gene-environment interactions, and the aggregate effect of multiple exposures.\n\n\nData Science Resources for Exposomics\nTo address these questions, exposomic research requires extensive cohort data that include measures of the exposome, genome, and phenome. Large-scale studies like NHANES and the UK Biobank provide rich datasets for analyzing the complex interactions between genes and the environment.\n\n\nExposome-Wide Association Studies (ExWAS)\nExWAS is a pivotal methodology in exposomics, analogous to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in genetics. It systematically examines the relationships between numerous environmental exposures and health outcomes. This data-driven approach allows for the identification of significant associations while controlling for multiple comparisons, making it a powerful tool for discovery in exposomics.\n\n\n\nExWAS Considerations (from Chung et al, Exposome 2024)\n\n\n\n\nThe Complexity of the Exposome\nThe exposome’s complexity arises from its time-dependent, correlated, and interactive nature. Different modalities of exposure, such as chemicals, physical activity, and socioeconomic status, must be considered collectively to understand their impact on health. The architecture of the exposome includes both shared and non-shared environmental factors, requiring sophisticated statistical models to disentangle these effects.\n\n\nMethodological Advances\nRecent advances in data science have enabled the development of models that can handle the complexity of exposomic data. Techniques such as machine learning, regression models, and mixed models are employed to analyze the dense correlation structures and sparsity of exposure data. Additionally, methods to control for false discovery rates and variable selection are critical to ensuring the robustness of findings.\n\n\nExposome-Phenome Atlas\nOne of the significant advancements in exposomics is the creation of an exposome-phenome atlas. This comprehensive database maps the relationships between various exposures and phenotypes, providing a valuable resource for researchers. By performing ExWAS across multiple cohorts, this atlas facilitates the identification of consistent and replicable associations, enhancing our understanding of how environmental factors contribute to disease.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe integration of data science methodologies into exposomic research represents a paradigm shift in environmental health. By leveraging large-scale cohort data and advanced analytical techniques, researchers can uncover the intricate relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes. This approach not only enhances our understanding of disease etiology but also informs precision public health interventions aimed at reducing the burden of environmental diseases.\nAcknowledgements to collaborators and funding support from NIEHS, NIA, NIDDK, and NIAID."

The exposome is a complement of the genome, consisting of the totality of non-genetic factors of behavior and our environment, including dietary nutrients, lifestyle, infectious agents, pollutants, and extreme temperature.\nWe attempt to dissect the relationship between the genome and exposome in complex phenotypes by using data science and machine learning approaches in large scale data such as electronic health records, biobanks, and real-world data, integrating exposure monitoring, multi-omic measurements to ultimately create a comprehensive map of human health.\n\n\n\nPatel et al, JAMA 2014\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Science: research on research\nAre findings from high-throughput exposomic and genomic research clinically or biologically useful? For example, after many years of diet-related investigation, including our own here and here, it is a challenge to navigate findings on what the optimal diet might be. How can we do the best job possible to ensure big data science is translatable?\nWe develop computer intensive approaches to make big data based findings more robust to accelerate meta science, or the “science of science”. We use these data approaches to study how and why we come to the conclusions that we do and if these conclusions are robust. For example, “vibration of effects” attempts to estimate how much arbitrary big data choices can change the outcome of a study and decision making! \n\n\nInvestigating disease-related phenotypes: diabetes, dementia, and aging\nPhenotypes such as diabetes, biological age, and dementia are ripe for discovery. We are also investigating whether utilization of care are made worse by extreme environmental events, particularly among the aged.\n\n\nAffiliations\nWe are part of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Chirag Patel participates in DBMI’s educational programs, including:\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine,\nBioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,\nMaster’s in Biomedical Informatics,\nSummer Institute in Biomedical Informatics\n\n\n\nSupport\nWe are or have been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Harvard Data Science Institute, and the Harvard-Chan NIEHS Center. We are thankful for the compute and infrastructural support from Sanofi, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Google."

    "text": "Ming Kei (Jake) Chung earned his PhD in Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley where he received training at the Center for Exposure Biology to develop novel tools for exposure assessment.  He has a long-term research interest to understand how environmental and genetic factors interplay and affect human health and disease. Since graduation, he has been involved in exposomics and epidemiological studies elucidating the relationships between complex environmental exposures and subtle molecular changes.  Realizing the analytical challenges to get an integrated perspective on massive omics data, he joined the Patel Group to further polish his bioinformatics skills.  Current projects include analyzing metabolome-wide data to investigate the diurnal effects on truck drivers and studying the pregnancy exposome in collaboration with NICHD.  By combining the wet lab experience and dry lab skills, he is hoping to develop a new generation of exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) method for discovering the unknown causes of common human diseases."
