    "text": "The long-term research goal of Chirag Patel’s Group is to solve problems in human health and disease by developing bioinformatics approaches to reason over large-scale environmental exposure and genomic information spanning molecules to populations.\n\nUntangling exposures, genotypes, and phenotypes\nWho we are -- our phenotype -- is determined by the interplay between our genomes and exposomes, defined as the totality of non-genetic factors experienced from birth to death, which includes drugs, diet, infectious agents, extreme temperature, and pollutants.\nWe attempt to dissect the relationship between the genome and exposome in complex phenotypes by deploying high-throughput data science and machine learning approaches in large data such as electronic health records, biobanks, and epidemiological cohorts, integrating exposure monitoring, multi-omic measurements of exposure, the microbiome, and genome sequence information, attaining a data-driven picture of human phenotypes, such as diabetes.\n\n\n\nPatel et al, JAMA 2014\n\n\n\n\nMeta-Science: research on research\nAre findings from high-throughput exposomic and genomic research clinically or biologically useful? For example, after many years of diet-related investigation, including our own here and here, it is a challenge to navigate findings on what the optimal diet might be. How can we do the best job possible to ensure big data science is translatable?\nWe develop computer intensive approaches to make big data based findings more robust to accelerate meta science, or the “science of science”. We use these data approaches to study how and why we come to the conclusions that we do and if these conclusions are robust or reproducible. For example, “vibration of effects” attempts to estimate how much arbitrary big data choices can change the outcome of a study and decision making! \n\n\nInvestigating disease-related phenotypes: diabetes, dementia, and aging\nPhenotypes such as diabetes, biological age, and dementia are ripe for exposomic discovery. We are developing approaches to identify the causal environmental determinants – and predictors – of these complex phenotypes and diseases. We are also investigating whether utilization of care are made worse by extreme environmental events, particularly among the aged.\n\n\nAffiliations\nWe are part of the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School. Chirag Patel is a mentor in DBMI’s educational programs, including:\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine,\nBioinformatics and Integrative Genomics,\nMaster’s in Biomedical Informatics,\nSummer Institute in Biomedical Informatics\n\n\n\nSupport\nWe are or havee been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Harvard Data Science Institute, and the Harvard-Chan NIEHS Center.
